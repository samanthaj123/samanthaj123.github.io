### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first labs we did. It was very challenging, due to the fact I had never coded before, but slowly got the hang of it when my partner had explained it to me. In this lab we had to input two numbers and output the sum of the two numbers.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was another one of my favorites because I used to love playing Mad Libs when I was a kid. It was confusing at first since this was our second lab and I had never coded before. But this was one of the easier labs and got the hang of it. In this lab we filled in the blanks for protein, bread, and condiments with specific ingredients and when the user typed in the commads, a sandwich would be outputted. 

* Lab 4 

    Lab 4 part 1, was another one of my favorites because I love math and I got to use it for the first time when coding, and actually understanding how to input it correctyl. In this lab we chose two specific dates and subtracted the two dates to see how many days were in between the two.
